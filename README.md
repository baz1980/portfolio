# portfolio

This project involved building a portfolio website from scratch, adding
certain info/elements such as, profile picture, bio, examples of work done and links.
Instead of displaying my contact info, I instead, decided to create links for both mobile number and email.

Please note that i am new to coding and as such have not yet built up a portfolio of completed work. I have reserved space
for future work to be added as this course continues, and ask for your understanding on this. i view this portfoilio website page as a work in progress
that i will update and improve as my coding knowledge/skills allow.
